# Decentralized Lending Platform

## Project Description
This project is a blockchain-based decentralized lending platform built on the Aptos blockchain using Move smart contracts. The platform enables users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies directly from each other without the need for intermediaries or centralized financial institutions. The contract facilitates secure peer-to-peer transactions with transparent fund management.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to democratize access to financial services by eliminating middlemen and allowing anyone to participate in lending and borrowing activities. By leveraging decentralized technology, we aim to create a trustless and efficient ecosystem where users can manage assets freely and securely.

## Future Scope
- **Interest Rates**: Implement dynamic interest rate models for lending and borrowing.
- **Collateral Mechanism**: Introduce collateral-based borrowing to ensure secure loans.
- **Multi-Token Support**: Expand the platform to support various token standards beyond AptosCoin.
- **Reputation System**: Add borrower and lender reputation scoring for trust enhancement.
- **Front-end DApp Integration**: Develop a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the smart contract.
- **Automated Liquidation**: Implement automatic loan liquidation in case of default.

## Key Features
- Peer-to-peer lending and borrowing without intermediaries.
- Secure fund transfers and management using Aptos blockchain.
- Minimalistic and gas-efficient smart contract design.
- Lender vaults to manage and track deposited funds.
- Borrower access to funds with validation and safety checks.
